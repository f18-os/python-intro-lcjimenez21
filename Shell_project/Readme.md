This repository contains the code for the python shell lab. The
purpose is to have a understanding of how processes work using
python to create a shell that would allow simple I/O redirection
and basic piping. IN order to exit the shell you need to input
the key word "exit".


`$ ./shell.py`
* Allows I/O redirection
* Allows to do piping
* Is case-insensitive
